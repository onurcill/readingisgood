## Project Structure & Design
**MULTI-MODULE MAVEN PROJECT** 


![image](https://i.ibb.co/LRqGrgB/structure.png)

- **App Module :** It contains the basic to run the Spring Boot Application. It uses only reading-is-good-rest module.
- **Bom Module :** It contains dependencies and manages dependencies
- **Parent Module :** It defines reading-is-good-bom module manage dependencies
- **Data Module :** It contains all the data repositories and access logic
- **Rest Module :** The REST interface and implementation. It also contains mappers.It uses the business logic included in reading-is-good-service module.
- **Service Module :** It contains business logic. It contains DTO's and mappers. It use the reading-is-good-data module to access data.
- **Grpc Module :** According to my design, this module can be added easily in the future. Using the same business, we can provide grpc endpoints with rest.

## GIT Flow
Can be thought of as a short-term project. Although it is a short-term study, we must continue to apply some principles.Finished my work on feature, develop and master branches.

# Build & Run

This is a step-by-step guide how to build and run the project using Docker.

- First you need to install dependencies by running clean and install maven commands.
- Then to build and run the project on docker, you need to run following commands:
    - docker build -f Dockerfile -t readingisgood-docker .
    - docker images (to see if image is build)
    - docker run -p 8080:8080 readingisgood-docker
- Once you run the server you can access the project at port 8080.
- You can see API documentation http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
- To access endpoints you need the first call <b>/api/v1/authorization</b> request. This will generate jwt token and set value to the request header with **JWT** key.
- Then you can call other APIs.


## Postman
